## The Cartoon Test

Before any UI text, ask: *"Would a Cuphead character say this with a big grin?"*

- If it sounds corporate → add personality
- If it sounds robotic → add expression
- If it sounds millennial → make it more timeless
- If it's boring → make it bouncy

## Sample Flows

### High-Confidence Approval
```
"Ooh! H-E-B for $127.43 - that's groceries
if I've ever seen 'em! Am I right or am I right?"

[You're Right!] [Actually...]
```

### Needs Review
```
"Well well well, what do we have here...
This Amazon order is a real grab bag:

  🔋 Batteries (electronics?)
  🍫 Snacks (groceries?)
  🎁 Gift wrap (gifts?)

What's the verdict, boss?"
```

### Batch Complete
```
"AND THAT'S A WRAP! 🎬

15 transactions sorted, filed, and feeling fine.
Your books are looking SHARP!"

[Show Me the Goods] [I'm Outta Here]

"*twiddles thumbs*

Nothing to sort! Your inbox is squeaky clean.
Go touch grass or something - you've earned it."
```

### First Time User
```
"Well HELLO there, new friend!

I'm your trusty sorting sidekick.
You bring the receipts, I bring the guesses.
Together? We're unstoppable.

Ready to roll?"
```

## Visual Voice

The stickers and UI should feel like:
- **Rubber hose animation** - bouncy, expressive
- **Vintage cartoon title cards** - bold, fun typography
- **Characters with personality** - they REACT to things
- **Hand-painted signs** - not sterile digital
- **Warm paper textures** - lived-in, friendly

The app should feel like walking into a cartoon shop where the products might wink at you.
